<h2>My Reflection about the Movie</h2>
<p>The Chronicle of Narnia is one of the best movies I've watched. 
    This movie taught me how important it is to have a balance between good and evil, and evil cannot win over the goodness that we have within ourself.
    Though this movie is about the struggle between light and darkness it also
    taught us courage and redemption with a promise of a brigther future always within reach.
